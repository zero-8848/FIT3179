    <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
    <p>Road safety is a paramount concern in today's fast-paced world, with millions of lives at stake every year. Our dashboard sheds light on global trends and patterns, emphasizing the critical need for proactive measures and informed decision-making to ensure safer roads for all.

      <p>There are large disparities in road traffic death rates between regions. The risk of dying as a result of a road traffic injury is highest in the African Region (26.6 per 100 000 population), and lowest in the European Region (9.3 per 100 000).The choropleth map above shows the number of road death per 100,000 population across countries. The number of road death per 100,000 population will be refered as <b>Death Rate</b> in the following parts of the dashboard.

  <h2><b>How Road Death Rates Relate to Population Density</b></h2>

  <div class="w3-center">

    <p>This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between a country's population density and its road death rate. Interestingly, the data suggests an inverse relationship: as population density increases, the death rate tends to decrease. This counterintuitive trend may be attributed to various factors such as better infrastructure, stricter traffic regulations, or more public transportation options in densely populated areas. It underscores the importance of understanding the multifaceted factors that contribute to road safety.

    <p>Upon examining the road death rates across the top 10 countries, several noteworthy observations can be made. Germany generally appears near the top, often holding the highest death rate, though it has been second on occasion. This is a point of concern for such a developed nation. In contrast, Australia, where I am currently pursuing my studies, tends to have a relatively lower death rate, suggesting effective road safety measures in place. A particularly evident trend across these countries is the gender disparity. Males consistently have a much higher death rate compared to females, highlighting an urgent need for targeted interventions and awareness campaigns.

  <h2><b>Trends in Australia's Road Death Rate Over the Years</b></h2>

  <div class="w3-center">

    <p>Analyzing the line chart, we can observe a promising trend in Australia's road safety efforts. The road death rate per 100,000 people has been consistently decreasing over the years. This decline indicates the effectiveness of various safety measures, regulations, and awareness campaigns implemented in the country. The continuous effort to enhance road safety has evidently paid off, making Australian roads safer for its residents with each passing year.

          <h2>Map Visualization</h2>
          <p>Delve into a comprehensive visual exploration that showcases the varying rates of road traffic fatalities across nations. This map provides a clear and detailed perspective, highlighting the disparities in road safety measures and outcomes worldwide. By understanding these patterns, stakeholders can identify areas of concern and work towards creating safer road environments for all.The Global status report on road safety 2018, launched by WHO in December 2018, highlights that the number of annual road traffic deaths has reached 1.35 million. Road traffic injuries are now the leading killer of people aged 5-29 years. The burden is disproportionately borne by pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, in particular those living in developing countries. The report suggests that the price paid for mobility is too high, especially because proven measures exist. Drastic action is needed to put these measures in place to meet any future global target that might be set and save lives.This list of countries by traffic-related death rate shows the annual number of road fatalities per capita per year, per number of motor vehicles, and per vehicle-km in some countries in the year the data was collected.

            According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road traffic injuries caused an estimated 1.35 million deaths worldwide in 2016.[2] That is, one person is killed every 26 seconds on average.
            
            Only 28 countries, representing 449 million people (seven percent of the world's population), have laws that address the five risk factors of speed, drunk driving, helmets, seat-belts and child restraints.[citation needed] Over a third of road traffic deaths in low- and middle-income countries are among pedestrians and cyclists. However, less than 35 percent of low- and middle-income countries have policies in place to protect these road users.[3] The average rate was 17.4 per 100,000 people. Low-income countries now have the highest annual road traffic fatality rates, at 24.1 per 100,000, while the rate in high-income countries is lowest, at 9.2 per 100,000.[3]
            
            Seventy-four percent of road traffic deaths occur in middle-income countries, which account for only 53 percent of the world's registered vehicles. In low-income countries it is even worse. Only one percent of the world's registered cars produce 16 percent of world's road traffic deaths. This indicates that these countries bear a disproportionately high burden of road traffic deaths relative to their level of motorization.[3]
