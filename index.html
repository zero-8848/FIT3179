    <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
    <p>Road safety is a paramount concern in today's fast-paced world, with millions of lives at stake every year. Our dashboard sheds light on global trends and patterns, emphasizing the critical need for proactive measures and informed decision-making to ensure safer roads for all.

      <p>There are large disparities in road traffic death rates between regions. The risk of dying as a result of a road traffic injury is highest in the African Region (26.6 per 100 000 population), and lowest in the European Region (9.3 per 100 000).The choropleth map above shows the number of road death per 100,000 population across countries. The number of road death per 100,000 population will be refered as <b>Death Rate</b> in the following parts of the dashboard.

  <h2><b>How Road Death Rates Relate to Population Density</b></h2>

  <!-- Text -->
  <div class="w3-center">

    <p>This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between a country's population density and its road death rate. Interestingly, the data suggests an inverse relationship: as population density increases, the death rate tends to decrease. This counterintuitive trend may be attributed to various factors such as better infrastructure, stricter traffic regulations, or more public transportation options in densely populated areas. Notably, countries like <b>Australia</b> and <b>Singapore</b>, which have been labeled on the plot, exemplify this trend. While Australia has a low population density and a correspondingly low death rate, Singapore, despite its high population density, also boasts a low death rate. On the other hand, <b>Namibia</b>, with its low population density, surprisingly has a high death rate. These labeled examples highlight the diverse scenarios across countries and underscore the importance of understanding the multifaceted factors that contribute to road safety.</p>  </div>

  <h2><b>8 Countries by Road Death Rates: A Gender Perspective</b></h2>

  <div class="w3-center">

    <p>Upon examining the road death rates across 8 countries, several noteworthy observations can be made. Germany generally appears near the top, often holding the highest death rate, though it has been second on occasion. This is a point of concern for such a developed nation. In contrast, Australia, where I am currently pursuing my studies, tends to have a relatively lower death rate, suggesting effective road safety measures in place. A particularly evident trend across these countries is the gender disparity. Males consistently have a much higher death rate compared to females, highlighting an urgent need for targeted interventions and awareness campaigns.

  <div class="w3-center">

    <p>Analyzing the line chart, we can observe a promising trend in Australia's road safety efforts. The road death rate per 100,000 people has been consistently decreasing over the years. This decline indicates the effectiveness of various safety measures, regulations, and awareness campaigns implemented in the country. The continuous effort to enhance road safety has evidently paid off, making Australian roads safer for its residents with each passing year.
